# The root of the entire project

# This is the version number of your code.  This will change each time you make
# a new release.  The most popular approach is to use Semantic Versioning,
# described at https://semver.org/
__version__ = "0.1.3"


# Version History
# 0.1.1 Intial relase with tiny and min mamba models
# 0.1.2 Add iTransformer and utils
# 0.1.3 Module name changes and correct imports
